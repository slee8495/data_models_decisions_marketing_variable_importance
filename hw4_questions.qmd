This post implements a few measure of variable importance, interpreted as a key drivers analysis, for certain aspects of a payment card on customer satisfaction with that payment card.


_todo: replicate the table on slide 19 of the session 4 slides. This involves calculating pearson correlations, standardized regression coefficients, "usefulness", Shapley values for a linear regression, Johnson's relative weights, and the mean decrease in the gini coefficient from a random forest. You may use packages built into R or Python._

_If you want a challenge, either (1) implement one or more of the measures yourself. "Usefulness" is rather easy to program up. Shapley values for linear regression are a bit more work. Or (2) add additional measures to the table such as the importance scores from XGBoost._
